                        <p>If you believe that you've developed one of the mental health ailments,
                            try to remember that your friends are looking out for your best interests.
                            They want you to be well, and they are not attacking you.
                            Talking about your problems with someone close to you may seem like a daunting task, 
                            but try to let them help you until you are ready to seek the professional help you need to get better.
                            The stresses of being away from home, managing coursework,
                            and finding your path can lead to intense feelings of inadequacy.
                            You may feel helpless, as if you are just going through the motions,
                            especially when you realize you're not having the fun everyone insisted you would.
                            These feelings, left unchecked, can lead to depression. With that in mind,
                            it is important to understand how to both recognize signs of depression and how to keep yourself healthy.
                            
                        </p>

                        <p> depression is the number one reason students drop out of school,
                            and is a gateway issue that, if left untreated,
                            could lead to other symptoms or even suicide.
                            Depression is a common but serious illness that leaves you feeling despondent and helpless,
                            completely detached from the world. It can interfere with your life,
                            making important everyday tasks such as working, studying, sleeping, and eating difficult.
                            Identifying these issues in others can be tricky, 
                            as students often downplay or simply never talk about something deeply bothering them,
                            often due to insecurities, fear of standing out or embarrassment, 
                            and peers can easily misdiagnose one another, sometimes making matters worse.
                        </p>

                        <p>Incoming college freshman are often told that college is the best four years of their lives. 
                            You have a new independence to do what you want (within, of course, legal bounds) 
                            and you are free to explore who you are and what interests you most.
                            But with that freedom comes many new factors over which you may feel like you have little to no control, 
                            like making friends, getting along with roommates, or choosing classes for a specific semester.
                            Witnessing this can be bewildering and you won't have all the answers. 
                            But what you can do is be a good listener when someone attempts to discuss their issues.
                            Offering words of encouragement shows your friend you are a source of support rather than one of criticism 
                            or judgment. Avoid telling your friends to “cheer up” or “snap out of it.” 
                            Many who are depressed are aware of their condition, and telling them to get over it,
                            even with good intentions, is not helpful. They often don't have control over how 
                            they feel during their downward turns.

                            It is important to seek help from professionals for any level of depression, 
                            so if you feel your friend is at risk, gently encourage them to seek help and offer to accompany them,
                            be it to a student health center or a doctor's appointment. Remember, however,
                            that while talking through their issues with you may be helpful, it is not a substitute for treatment,
                            and that depression can worsen or lead to a number of other mental illnesses if left untreated.
