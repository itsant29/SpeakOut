                        <p>College is all about many things preparing you for a career,
                            transitioning from teen to adult, and establishing a love for lifelong learning.
                            College is an opportunity for you to take charge of the direction of your life. 
                            For the first time, you are now in charge of the classes you take, how much you'll study,
                            and what you'll experience. One of the most important elements of success in college is truly
                            understanding your strengths and weaknesses. Take some time to review your strengths 
                            things like creativity, communications skills, computer skills, work ethic as well as your
                            weaknesses things like time management, procrastination, perfectionism. 
                            It will probably be really easy to develop a list of your strengths,
                            but much harder to really examine your weaknesses. The key with this tip is to find 
                            a way to maximize your strengths while overcoming or minimizing your weaknesses.
 
                        </p>

                        <p>Of all the things high-achieving college students say,
                            the one thing repeated over and over again is the importance of managing your time.
                            Whether you use an electronic gadget or an old-fashioned planner or calendar,
                            you need to not only have a system of keeping track of important dates and deadlines,
                            but also a system for prioritizing your time. Having a strong sense of your time needs
                            also gives you the ability to better see if you can handle additional responsibilities 
                            and the power to decline offers that are going to seriously hurt your academic performance.
                            Even students with great time management systems talk about the importance of keeping 
                            important dates in the top of your mind. Because you do not have teachers and parents 
                            on your back reminding you of assignments and tests, it's much easier to procrastinate
                            in college, putting off what you could have accomplished today until tomorrow,
                            or the day after, or the day after that. Professors have very little leniency or 
                            empathy for students who attempt to hand in late assignments especially ones that 
                            have been on the course calendar all semester.
 
 
                        </p>

                        <p>One of the best ways to improve your academic performance is to establish a study routine
                            a time everyday that you set aside to read your textbooks, review your notes, and work on
                            homework assignments. Not only will you get more accomplished, you'll be better prepared 
                            for your classes, and actually have more free time to do other things. Most experts say that
                            for every hour in class, you should devote at least two to three hours outside of class for
                            studying. Besides just setting aside time each day, you should also find the best environment 
                            for you to study, which for some people is their dorm rooms while for others it's the library.
                            Another common theme among high-achieving college students is that the best studying comes not 
                            from massively long cramming sessions, but from many (daily) study sessions spread over a long 
                            period of time, with short breaks taken between assignments or subjects. Study for an hour, then
                            take a 10-minue break. Study for another hour, and take another break. By following a system of
                            studying and taking short breaks, you'll not only learn the material, but actually retain it much
                            longer than cramming the day before a big test. One option that many top-performing students talk
                            about for the study breaks is doing something physical; many belief in the connection between a healthy body and a healthy mind.
